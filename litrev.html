    <h1><img src="images/border.png" alt="border" /> Mitigating Corporate Information Exposure on the Web </h1>
    <p>
    A data breach refers to an incident in which an individual has unauthorised access to private or confidential information that they use or expose, with intent to cause harm. Reducing exposure of corporate information is of greater requirement now than in recent years; with technology constantly evolving, hackers are finding new devious ways to grant unauthorised access. This review will specifically focus on the methods hackers use, the most common type of data leakage. I will be using resources from online newspapers, blogs, corporate websites, and more.

    </p>
    <p>
      Information can be leaked over different reasons; for example, externally by hackers, or internal employees leaking data with intent, or, more often; inadvertently. The SANS institute, 2007, Peter Gordon states that 96% of internal threats are inadvertent data breaches, meaning they were unplanned or unintentional suggesting the significance that training employees has to prevent many data exposures. To mitigate accidental internal leakage, employees must understand to never open attachments from unrecognised emails, as well as avoiding suspicious links, websites and advertisements. Most importantly, employees must confirm security details whenever giving out sensitive information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite that motivations for exposing information being varied, disclosing specific types of data, such as confidential information may promote severer damage to corporate reputation. A well-known corporate in the service sector, such as the NHS has greater pressure to uphold the public’s trust, therefore have a greater requirement to keep updating software’s and security measures. The SANS Institute, 2007, reports that 73% of leaked data was customer information. Its high popularity amongst the types of data exposed, suggests the higher risk and severer consequences.

      E-mails often contain links to malicious website may be sent in innocent-looking form, with intention to spread malware to manipulate or steal confidential information from the user’s computer system. This is called a Trojan virus – defined by Panda Security as files that install various applications enabling hackers to control your computer. SSL, also known as Proxy Avoidance, allows users to visit a URL of their choice whilst encrypting their entire session. Consequently, it refuses the firewall from looking into the data – information that gets leaked will be undetectable through the firewall. . Companies using old software’s are at higher risk by not meeting the constantly evolving security needs, leaving themselves exposed to more advanced security threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day to day activities of employees, such as working remotely, is another way for a company exposes itself to data exposure risk; employees may use their personal computers that are unsecured and vulnerable to hacking, or may complete their work on a train. Therefore, employees must follow procedures to minimise exposure, such as using secure computers with the latest software’s installed, and working in trusted environments where information cannot be obtained or stolen by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different approaches taken to protect information from being leaked includes keyword filtering; this method detects specific words or phrases, often used in E-mails to discover employees that may have leaked confidential data through sending someone an attachment or a link of a file. The keyword filter method captures specific phrases used in emails containing attachments, for example, "confidential file" and flagging the email that has been sent, and capturing the emails of the sender and receiver. However, there are weaknesses, since "HTTPS representing a complex challenge due to the encryption of the traffic".

      Finding alternatives to USB sticks, that are also prone to virus infections, contributes to minimising risk of information exposure. Due to their portable nature, USBs can be easily misplaced, giving opportunity for the finder to access files by simply inserting into their own computer, which leads to even further risks of virus infections. Symantec reported in March 2007 that “Theft or loss of a computer or data storage medium, such as a USB memory key, made up 54% of all identity theft-related data breaches”. Applications such as slurp.exe have ability to automatically copy every business document from the computer it is connected to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatives to USB drives, include using the Cloud to store information and encouraging users to use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols when setting passwords. Due to the nature of the Cloud not having physical components, users can be more aware if a second user has access to their account. For example, internet corporations such as YouTube, Google and Facebook notify the user if a new device has signed in via their email. Microsoft Office online is another example that notifies the user if a second person has access to their account. These security measures enables the user to be notified about a potential hacker from earlier, as well as finding trace and having a higher chance to identify the hacker, than it would if somebody unknown had access to a USB drive which is less trackable. The sooner the company is aware about unauthorised access the sooner they can prepare against hackers. Network and application security tests can be performed to assess the risk from individuals who, intentionally or inadvertently put corporation information at risk. The final decision of security continues stay in the hands of the user or employee; internal individuals who wish to leak corporate information has ability to do so, simply by printing the data out and walking out of the office. Antivirus products and firewalls generally prevent users from being infected with malware that aim to install data stealing applications onto the user’s computer system. However organisations remain under pressure to continuously update their security system to win over ever evolving malware mutation capabilities.

    <p>
      Organiations should keep their company software up to date in order to minimise the risks of malicious and original cyber-attacks. Corporates must also develop a security plan which suits their own risk tolerance, through estimation of impact an exploitation of sensitive information would have. Assessing security measures is another crucial step in mitigating corporate information exposure on the web. Organisations with a contingency plan prepared for data exposures along with constantly updating security system will be most effective at enhancing security and reducing risk.
