    <h1>Discovery Log</h1>
<h2>Week 1 – Welcome to Web Foundations 1</h2>
<p>I missed the first week since I started later than everybody else, however, looking back, I can see that there were valuable lectures which covered universal skills such as time management, which also reflected challenging difficulties faced by final-year students. Lectures like these are sometimes more valuable to me, since they cover aspects of personal growth, which goes beyond the typical lecture and gives us students the ability to apply these skills continuously and in every aspect of education. </p>
<h2>Week 2 – Information Security & Unit Prep</h2>
<p>This is where we started our VM’s, and prepared for our literature reviews by reading further into “Information Security Management Principles”, which taught us about information security principles, information risk and more.</p>
<h2>Week 3 – Web Security </h2>
<p> In this lecture we were reminded how accessible or easily exposed our private information can be as we’re always leaving a digital footprint, thanks to social media platforms, data collecting websites, and even through simple things, like someone sitting next to you.</p>
<h2>Week 4 – Reviewing Literature </h2>
<p>We started our first coursework, which was an essay on mitigating corporate exposure on the web, this was really straightforward since we had done enough preparation through lectures and worksheets. </p>
<h2>Week 5 – Academic Writing </h2>
<p> In the fifth week, we learned how to structure our literature review, such as learning primary and secondary sources as well as how to reference using the APA 6 style.</p>
<h2>Week 6 – Introduction to Mark-up</h2>
<p>In this week’s introductory lecture, we looked at what HyperText Markup Language is and how it’s used to create our webpage. We looked at what characters HTML uses, such as <p> for paragraphs. We learned that HTML isn’t a programming language, it is in fact only used to allow website creation.</p>
<h2>Week 7 – Literature Review submission </h2>
<p>This piece of coursework was pretty straight forward, with lots of available resources on moodle from our lecturers, as well as both Google and university library search engine. I received valuable feedback from my peers which helped me improve my work. </p>
<h2>Week 8 – Separating Form and Content</h2>
<p>In the eighth week, we got introduced to CSS; which stands for cascading style sheet. CSS is used for styling and designing the webpage, it is where you implement colours, backgrounds, font sizes, padding, margins, etc. </p>
<h2>Week 9 – Productivity and Efficiency: Editors</h2>
<h2>Week 10 – Design</h2>
<p>In week 10, we looked at the definition of design, and the importance of design for users. For example, poor designs enables human error as the obscurity may end up confusing them.</p>
<h2>Week 11 – Using Images </h2>
<p> In week 11 we carried on investigating how we can use and change the examples to add media to our own pages.</p>
<h2>Week 12 – Christmas </h2>
<p>We looked at the advent calender webpage that was created, which was cool.</p>
<h2>Week 13 – Marking Scheme</h2>
<p>In the thirteenth week, we looked at the peer review marking guide, which helped us to become familiar with the peer marking. This also gave us an insight on what we need to work on to achieve our best marks.</p>
<h2>Week 14 - Addressing the Web</h2>
<p>In the fourteenth week, we were introduced to addressing in the web. the lecturer explained what parts of the web address means. To begin with, we looked at IP Addresses and found out that binary addresses are converted into the web addresses that we see. </p>
<h2>Week 15 - Usability</h2>
<p>In the fifteenth week, we looked at usability of the website, within this lecture and practical we looked at what is appropriate and what is not. You can find certain web pages which are unhelpful, such as a form on a website with no submit button. </p>
<h2>Week 16 - Accessibility</h2>
<p>In the sixteenth week, we discussed accessibility of a website for those who may be less able. This taught me that i should go for a very simple and user friendly design and simplistic use over the over complex features for my coursework and you have to take into account the users that will be using the website. </p>
<h2>Week 17 - Scalable Graphics on the Web</h2>
<p>In the seventeenth week, we looked at the SVG programming language in both lectures and practicals. With this we can create our own images which can be exported and saved in the format of picture types such as .jpeg and .png. In our practical, we were challenged by our lecturer, Dr. Rich Boakes, to a drawing challenge of the university logo and beat him to it. I lost to him as he has experience. However, i did learn a lot about how to draw the university logo just using shapes. One thing i did to practice, was use graph paper to draw it out with its size in cm, to work out how to make it using maths and i found that to be very helpful.</p>
<h2>Week 18 - Website Submission & Basic Scripting</h2>
<p>In the eighteenth week, we looked at javascript. We looked at making stickmans and making them move around. The good thing i found about this is that i was able to get an insight of the second year, the one thing i found great about this is the animated version on the web that is interactive. We were also shown how to make a game using stickmans with diemans. I personally used this when looking into creating a slider for a website, so when you click a button it will scroll down automatically.</p>
